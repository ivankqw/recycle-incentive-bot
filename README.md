## Inspiration
Have a bunch of e-wastes to recycle but need help with directions? Want to redeem cash for recylable materials but not sure where to go? Simply share your location with our Telegram bot and let it settle everything else for you. Quickly find recyling spots near you with our Telegram bot, R(easy)cle! 

As avid environmentalists, we found that recycling e-wastes can be quite a cumbersome task with the different categories of e-wastes to recycle to. On top of that, not all e-waste recycling points accept all categories of e-wastes, so one would have to take additional effort to search for a suitable recycling point. R(easy)cle solves this issue by providing directions to the nearest collection point with a touch of a button.

Similarly, finding Cash-for-trash stations can be a hassle as they are not easy to locate. 

## What it does
R(easy)cle is a user-friendly Telegram bot that helps you find recycling spots near you. All that is required is to select the type of recycling spot of your choice, and in a tap of your screen R(easy)cle will show u the way!

## How we built it
We built R(easy)cle using Python and telegrambot APIs for our bot, as well as pandas to perform data cleaning and manipulation.
